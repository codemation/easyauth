# Security Policy
Security is always top of mind especially when it comes to Authenticaiton and Authorization

## Updates
As `EasyAuth` is a plugin for FastAPI, the aim is to always support the latest release of FastAPI. Due to obvious time contraints, there can be delays & bugs introduced when using later versions of FastAPI with EasyAuth.

## Security Issues
Issues relating to vulnerabilities are naturally quite sensitive to discuss in a public issue. When or if such a bug is discovered, please email me @codemation - joshjamison1@gmail.com to provide details on the bug, how / where it is observed, and code examples where feasible.
